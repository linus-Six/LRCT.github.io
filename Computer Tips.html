                    <h1>1)A whole new start(Menu).</h1>
                    <p>The start menu is a Windows classic.</p>
                    <p>It's easily accessible through the stylized Windows icon in the corner of your screen.</p>
                    <p>Click on it, and you get a layout of your most-used programs, access to power options, and shortcuts to your file explorer and computer's settings.</p>
                    <p>Change the start menu's appearance when you right-click on the icon instead. </p>
                    <p>If you're using a touchscreen, then just touch the icon, hold it down for a second and then release.</p>
                    <p>Alternatively, use a keyboard shortcut by hitting the Windows key.</p>
                    <p>Right-clicking the Start icon delivers a quick and clean menu.</p>
                    <p>The access to programs is still there, but it also puts a lot more at your fingertips including the Task Manager, Control Panel, Device Manager, and even the trusty Command Prompt.</p>
                    <p>You can also access this advanced menu by hitting the Windows key + X.</p>

                    <p>Remember disk cleanup?</p>
                    <p>It was a way to make your computer run faster when PCs had less RAM than they do today.</p>
                    <p>Disk Cleanup fell by the wayside for most of us as PCs and laptops have become more sophisticated.</p>
                    <p>But your computer could still use a de-bloating now and again.</p>
                    <p>Disk Cleanup is a simple way to delete files and to ensure your Recycle Bin is cleared out.</p>
                    <p>On Windows 10, type "disk cleanup" into your taskbar where it says, "Type here to search" >> Click on Disk Cleanup app >> Put a check mark next to each folder you want to be deleted, such as temporary files. </p>

                    <p>It's more important than ever to have a multilayered approach to cybersecurity.</p>
                    <p>Windows Defender is a security tool that can be set up to block malware attacks in real time or you can perform a scan when you need it.</p>
                    <p>To make sure it's on, type "Windows Defender" into your taskbar >> Select Windows Defender app  >> Make sure Real-time protection is on.</p>
