                <h1>1)AMD or Intel?</h1>
                <p>Up until 2017, AMD was the clear underdog.</p>
                <p>But with its Ryzen / Threadripper series chips, the company has moved steadily toward performance parity with Intel.</p>
                <p>And in workloads that tax many cores, AMD's latest Ryzen 3000 CPUs have pulled ahead, especially if you factor in the security patches that have arrived over the past year or so.</p>
                <p>Some fans will have strong opinions, but if you don't have your heart set on one brand or the other, you should be open to either.</p>
                <p>Intel still holds a slight lead in gaming at 1080p in some games, if you're looking to extract the most frames-per-second possible out of your graphics card to display on your high-refresh monitor.</p>
                <p>But AMD has narrowed that gap considerably with its new Zen2 architecture, and tends to offer more cores and threads, which makes its CPUs better for professional-grade video editing and animation.</p>

                <h1>2)What do you want to do with your CPU?</h1>
                <p>It's tempting to just spend as much as you can afford for a CPU, but you might be better off saving some of your cash for other components.</p>
                <p>Determine your processor type and max budget based on what you need your computer to do.</p>

                <p>a) Basic tasks: $50-$100 (£35-£80) range.</p>
                <p>If you’re only after a chip that will let you watch video, browse the Web, and do basic productivity tasks like word processing and light spreadsheet work, then an entry-level chip with two or four cores might be just what you need.</p>
                <p>But if you often find yourself doing more than one of those basic tasks at once, it would be better to step up a model or two.</p>
                <p>Consider a Ryzen 3, like the AMD Ryzen 3 1300X or AMD Ryzen 3 2200G, or Intel Pentium on the high end of this price range and an Intel Celeron or chips like AMD's Athlon 200GE on the low end.</p>
                <p>b) Gaming: $150-$250 (£120-£220) range.</p>
                <p>If you’re primarily interested in high-end gaming performance, you should opt for a mid-range Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 CPU.</p>
                <p>Considering that the graphics card is more important for gaming than the processor, you can save money by not getting a more powerful Core i7 or Ryzen 7 chip.</p>
                <p>c) Creative media work or overclocking: $250-$350 (£220-£320) range.</p>
                <p>If you want more cores or speed for things like video editing—or you just want a fast, capable system with extra overhead for future computing tasks, splurge on a Ryzen 7 chip.</p>
                <p>d) Workstation muscle: $400+ (£370+).</p>
                <p>If you often find yourself waiting minutes or hours for your current system to render your 3D animation or 4K video, or you’re dealing with massive databases and complex math, consider an Intel Core X or AMD Threadripper CPU.</p>
                <p>These beasts offer massive amounts of physical cores (up to 64 as of this writing) for extreme multitasking (ex: gaming at high settings while streaming and editing) or time-consuming compute tasks.</p>
                <p>Business users can consider an Intel Xeon (like the recent Xeon W-3175X) or AMD EPYC processor, but those aren't consumer friendly--or reasonably affordable.</p>
                <p>For those not quite willing to step up to multi-thousand-dollar CPUs and platforms, AMD's 16-core Ryzen 9 3950X or 12-core Ryzen 9 3900X are both excellent alternatives that basically bring workstation-class performance to a mainstream platform.</p>

            <h1>3)What do you need more: clock speed, cores or threads?</h1>
            <p>The answer to this question really depends on your regular computing tasks.</p>
            <p>Higher clocks translate to quicker responsiveness and program load times (though RAM and storage speed is key here as well).</p>
            <p>Higher clock speeds also mean single-threaded tasks (like audio editing and certain older applications) can happen faster. Many popular games are still lightly threaded.</p>

            <p>But many modern programs can take advantage of lots of cores and threads.</p>
            <p>If you do lots of multitasking or edit high-res videos, or do other complex, time-consuming CPU-heavy tasks, you should prioritize the number of cores.</p>
            <p>But for the vast majority of gamers and general-purpose computer users, a clock speed ranging from 3-4GHz with four to eight cores is plenty.</p>
